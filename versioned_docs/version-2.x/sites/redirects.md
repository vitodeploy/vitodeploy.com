## Introduction

Vito supports URL redirections for your sites. You can redirect your site to another URL or path. This is useful when
you want to redirect your site to a new domain or a new path.

:::warning
Creating or deleting site redirects will regenerate the Nginx vhost file and any manual changes to the Nginx vhost will be lost.

the URL in the Location header.

### 307 Temporary Redirect
