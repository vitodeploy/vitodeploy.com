# Introduction

VitoDeploy or for short Vito is a self-hosted platform that automates server provisioning and application deployment for
PHP projects like
Laravel and WordPress, etc. It connects to your server remotely via SSH, installs necessary tools (e.g., Nginx, PHP,
MySQL), and
streamlines tasks like pulling code from repositories, managing environment variables, configuring web servers, and
issuing SSL certificates. With a user-friendly interface, it supports multi-site deployments, automated backups, and
performance monitoring, making it a convenient solution for managing servers and deploying applications efficiently.
