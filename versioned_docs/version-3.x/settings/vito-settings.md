Here you can manage some of the settings of your Vito instance.

## Export

You can export your Vito instance settings to a file. This file can be used to import the settings to another Vito
instance.

The exported file is a zip file which contains the following data:

- Database file
- Private keys of all the servers you provisioned using Vito
- Server logs
- Environment variables of your Vito instance

## Import

You can import the exported settings zip file back to Vito. This will restore your Vito instance to the state it was
when you exported it.
