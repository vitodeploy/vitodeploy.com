## Introduction

Vito uses source controls to pull your source codes for the websites you install. It also uses to set up hooks for auto
deployments.

## Supported Providers

- GitHub
- Gitlab (Cloud and Self-hosted)
- Bitbucket

## Required API Permissions

Vito connects to the source control providers via their APIs. To connect to the source control providers the following
information is required:

### Github

Generate a personal access token on GitHub settings of your account and give it full repository control and git hook
admin.

:::info
If you're using Github's fine grained personl tokens, Make sure you have Read & Write on `Administration`, `Contents` and `Webhooks` scopes.
:::

### Gitlab

Generate a personal access token on your Gitlab profile and give it `write_repository, api` permissions.

### Bitbucket (Deprecated)

:::warning
The Bitbucket source control provider is deprecated due to deprecation of App Passwords by Bitbucket. Use [Bitbucket V2](#bitbucket-v2) instead.
:::

Create an App Password on your Bitbucket account and give it repository and webhook admin permissions.

Vito will ask for username and password to connect to Bitbucket.

First you need to log into your Bitbucket account and navigate to [App Passwords](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/) under the Personal Settings and then create a password and copy.

The username field when connecting to Vito will be your account's username and the password will be the password you created using App Passwords.

### Bitbucket V2

This is a new source control provider for Bitbucket which is using Oauth Consumers of Bitbucket.

To connect, Navigate to your Bitbucket workspace and then `Oauth Consumers` and add a new consumer.

It is important to provide a callback URL (use your Vito instance's URL) and make sure you check the `This is a private consumer` checkbox.

Then create the consumer and use the `Key` and `Secret` to connect to it in Vito.

## Scope

Source controls can be created under a specific project or globally.

If you create a source control under a project, it will only be available for that project.

If you create a source control globally, it will be available for all projects.

The reason of this feature is when you add a new user to VitoDeploy, you can control which source controls they can
access.

:::info
In any scope, only you will have access to see or use that source control and other users of the project will not be able to see or use it.
