## Introduction

Vito exposes API endpoints that allows you to interact with your Vito instance programmatically. To use the API, you need to generate an API key.

## How to Generate an API Key

1. Go to the **Settings** section in the top navigation bar.
2. Click on the **API Keys** menu.
3. Click on the **Create** button.
4. Set a name for your API key.
5. Click on the **Create** button.
6. Copy the generated API key and store it securely. You won't be able to see it again.

## How to Use the API Key

VitoDeploy's API documentation is hosted on your Vito instance at `/api-docs/index.html`.
