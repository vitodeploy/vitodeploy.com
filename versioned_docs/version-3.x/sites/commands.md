## Introduction

Commands are useful tools that allow users to run single commands on the root directory of a site.

## Default Commands

Specific site types might come with default commands out of the box. For example, Laravel site comes with some of the useful artisan commands like `artisan up` or `artisan down` and etc.

## Variables

Similar to [Scripts](../scripts.md), Commands also support variables. You can define variables with `${VARIABLE_NAME}` format and Vito will ask for an input for these variables when you run the command.
