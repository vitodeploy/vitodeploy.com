VitoDeploy is now using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to power its documentation site ðŸŽ‰! The previous site was built using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) and here I will explain the reasons for this change.

## VitePress

VitePress is a static site generator powered by Vite. VitoDeploy was using VitePress for its documentation site. VitePress is a great tool for building documentation sites but mainly there was 2 challenges with it for VitoDeploy:

1. Versioning wasn't supported out of the box.
2. Blog posts were not supported out of the box.

## Docusaurus

Docusaurus is a static site generator powered by React. Docusaurus is a great tool for building documentation sites and it has great support for versioning and blog posts out of the box. Docusaurus also has a great community and ecosystem around it.
